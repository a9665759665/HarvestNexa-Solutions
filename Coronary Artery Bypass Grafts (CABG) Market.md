The demand for CABG procedures is increasing due to the rising prevalence of coronary artery diseases (CAD), an aging population, and advancements in surgical techniques and post-operative care. The market is expected to witness steady growth as more patients with severe coronary artery blockages opt for surgical intervention over medical therapies. Additionally, the availability of minimally invasive CABG surgeries is likely to attract more patients, further driving market growth during the forecast period.</p><p>The increasing healthcare expenditure, improved surgical outcomes, and rising patient awareness regarding heart diseases are key drivers influencing the CABG market. As more healthcare facilities adopt advanced technologies for cardiac surgeries, including robotic-assisted CABG procedures, the overall market is expected to expand. The market is also poised to benefit from the ongoing development of better grafting techniques and materials, reducing post-operative complications and enhancing long-term survival rates for patients. Moreover, growth in emerging economies with improving healthcare infrastructure is expected to further support the CABG market's positive outlook in the coming years.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Request PDF Sample Copy of Report: (Including Full TOC, List of Tables &amp; Figures, Chart)&nbsp;@&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/104698/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=265" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/104698/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=265</a></strong></strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class="">Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Vehicles Market&nbsp;Overview and Projection:</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation technique, the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Vehicles Market research study provides a comprehensive analysis of multiple market segments, including application, type, and location.
